# django-avatar has an option AVATAR_EXPOSE_USERNAMES, which is unfortunately set by default,
# resulting in usernames being used as directory names for avatar storage. When a user's username
# is changed, the original avatar images don't move and can still be located through the Avatar
# objects, which store their filenames, but the cached resized images are only read and written
# under the current username. The cached images under the previous username aren't deleted when
# the username changes and thus lie around orphaned in storage, causing a privacy issue since
# they can't be deleted when the user is anonymized. We're solving that problem by renaming the
# directories from current usernames to user ids, moving any original avatar images under old
# usernames into the new directories, deleting any directories with old usernames, and setting
# AVATAR_EXPOSE_USERNAMES to False. All avatars for a user (including any cached resized images
# generated later) will then be in the new user id directories, where they can be deleted along
# with the originals when a user is anonymized.
